# CryptoClustering
Module 19 Challenge

- This challenge was completed using lessons learned during class and in activities.
- Some challenges were encountered during this challenge.  My Anaconda Navigator was corrupted and I had to remove and re-install.  Upon reinstall, some of my results changed.  For example, the original elbow curve showed the best number of clusters was 4, but after reinstall it was now 2.  I'm not sure how this happened, but even after reloading the kernel, it was still 2.
